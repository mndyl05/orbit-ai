# Orbit AI — Google Docs™ Add-on

**Orbit AI** helps you uncover related ideas and resurface past notes inside Google Docs™ — making it easier to connect your thoughts and build a deeper understanding of your work.

---

## ✨ What it does
- Analyzes your current document context to find **related ideas** and **previous notes**.
- Displays relevant connections directly in the **sidebar** for quick reference.
- Encourages a more connected, reflective writing process — without leaving your doc.

---

## 🧩 How it works
1. Highlight text or open the sidebar from **Extensions → Orbit AI → Open Sidebar**.  
2. Orbit AI scans your Google Docs™ content (read-only) to generate context-aware insights.  
3. The sidebar presents connections and ideas retrieved via AI analysis.  
4. No data is stored permanently — cached results expire within 6 hours.
